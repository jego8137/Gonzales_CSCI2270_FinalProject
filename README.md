# Gonzales_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Summary: The program reads from a txt file (given) into a chained hash table. The user is allowed to insert elements, delete elements, as well as search for information regarding the table's contents. There is also a game.

How to Run: Create a console application in Code::Blocks. Delete the current main.cpp in the project and, using "Add Files", add: "main.cpp", "hashTable.h", and "hashTable.cpp" from this repository. Build and run. Copy "movieList.txt" into the console application's main folder so you can create a full hash table.

Requires Ubuntu
